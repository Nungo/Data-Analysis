The following two projects were excel csv files that contained unclean data. 

My task in utilising the data analysis skills that I learned again in the month bootcamp of my internship was to perform data analysis through cleaning the data and categorising it and sorting it out and visualising it. I also incorporated the cleaning of data using handling missing values and searching for duplicate values.

From there on, I was able to make a more accurate analysis of the data and what it signified.
